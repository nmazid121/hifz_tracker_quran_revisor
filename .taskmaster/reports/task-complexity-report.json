      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Environment",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into three subtasks: 1) Frontend setup with React/Vite, 2) Backend setup with Flask, and 3) Project configuration including README, linting, and repository structure. For each subtask, provide detailed steps, acceptance criteria, and estimated time.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves standard setup procedures for both frontend and backend, but requires coordination between the two environments. The task is well-defined with clear steps but involves multiple technologies and configuration points."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the QUL database integration into four subtasks: 1) Database connection and models, 2) API endpoints for page/juz/surah data, 3) Caching implementation, and 4) Data transformation utilities. For each subtask, specify the technical requirements, expected outputs, and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to working with specialized Quranic data structures, implementing efficient database queries, and creating a caching system. Requires domain knowledge of QUL database schema and optimization techniques for performance."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Dynamic Mushaf Page Rendering",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Mushaf page rendering task into five subtasks: 1) Component hierarchy implementation, 2) Data fetching and state management, 3) Arabic font integration and text rendering, 4) Navigation controls, and 5) Performance optimization. For each subtask, detail the implementation approach, challenges, and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to specialized Arabic text rendering requirements, complex layout needs, and performance considerations with many DOM elements. Requires careful component design and optimization to handle the unique challenges of Quranic text display."
    },

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the page reveal and mistake marking functionality into three subtasks: 1) Visibility toggle implementation with animations, 2) Word selection and mistake marking system, and 3) Mistake tracking utilities and keyboard shortcuts. For each subtask, specify the UI/UX requirements, state management approach, and testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving interactive UI elements, state management for marked words, and implementing smooth transitions. Requires careful consideration of user experience but uses standard React patterns."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the audio recording functionality into four subtasks: 1) MediaRecorder implementation with basic controls, 2) Audio storage and management, 3) Playback interface with progress tracking, and 4) Mobile optimization and permissions handling. For each subtask, detail the technical approach, browser compatibility considerations, and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to working with browser audio APIs, handling permissions, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and optimizing for mobile devices. Requires careful error handling and fallback strategies."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the rating and notes UI into two subtasks: 1) Rating selection component with visual indicators and tooltips, and 2) Notes input with validation and session summary view. For each subtask, specify the UI components, state management, and form handling requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Lower complexity as it primarily involves standard form components and UI elements. The main challenges are in creating an intuitive interface and proper form validation, but uses common React patterns."
    },

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the recitation data storage backend into three subtasks: 1) Database schema design and migration, 2) CRUD API endpoints implementation, and 3) Data validation, filtering, and backup utilities. For each subtask, detail the technical requirements, API contracts, and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving database design, API development, and data validation. Requires careful consideration of data integrity and query optimization, but uses standard backend development patterns."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Session Submission Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the session submission integration into four subtasks: 1) Data collection and formatting service, 2) Submission flow with validation and feedback, 3) Offline support with queue management, and 4) Session history and continuation features. For each subtask, specify the technical approach, error handling strategy, and testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to integrating multiple components, implementing offline support, and ensuring data integrity across the submission flow. Requires careful state management and error handling."
